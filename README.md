## Instructions

This is a "The Memory Game" known also as a "Concentration Game". There are 16 cards each card has a pair. Each time you click a card it will flip open to reveal the symbol it has.

You must try and match each card with it's identical pair card. The aim of the game is to get all the matching cards in the shortest amount of moves and time that you can, keeping the highest rating of 3 stars. Each time you play try and beat your last time, moves it took you to complete and try to keep your star rating at the highest rating which is 3 stars! The more you concentrate the better you will get and the more you play you will notice your concentration improve all while having fun! 

You get flippin and reap the rewards!

This was my firt Javascript, HTML and CSS project with Udacity and Google. I really enjoyed watching the pieces coming together as I learned more and more about approaching projects and working with Javascript to make the game interactive and responsive but mainly functional and fun!

I want to say a big thank you to everyone who helped me along the way!
